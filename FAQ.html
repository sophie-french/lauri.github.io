            <h3>I have collated my answers to some common questions people ask when they find out I've been to space</h3>

            <img class="center" src="Images/divider2.gif">

            <p><b>Q: What inspired you to become an astronaut and an aerospace engineer?</b></p>

            <p>A: Space has always been a fascinating topic for me. As a child, I loved learning about the planets and stars, and I was always eager to find out more about the universe. When I learned that people actually went to space and that there were careers in aerospace engineering, I knew that I wanted to be a part of it. Iâ€™m inspired by the idea of exploration and discovery, and I believe that space has a lot to offer us.</p>

            <p><b>Q: What is your favorite part about being an astronaut?</b></p>


            <p>A: My favorite part about being an astronaut is the opportunity to see and experience things that most people will never have the chance to see. It is truly a privilege to be able to view the Earth from space and to work on cutting-edge research and technology onboard the International Space Station.</p>


            <p><b>Q: What do you think is the greatest challenge in being an astronaut?</b></p>

            <p>A: One of the greatest challenges in being an astronaut is staying healthy in space. The human body is not well-suited for living in microgravity for extended periods of time. So, we have to be very careful about maintaining our health and fitness while on a space mission.</p>

            <p><b>Q: What is a typical day like for you?</b></p>


            <p>A: I don't really have a "typical" day, which is one of the great things about my job. I could be working on designing a new spacecraft one day, and the next day I could be flying that spacecraft on a test mission. I also spend a lot of time training for future space missions, both in the simulator and in real life. And of course, I also spend time with my family and friends when I'm not working.</p>

            <p><b>Q: What is the most exciting thing about your job?</b></p>

            <p>A: The most exciting thing about my job is definitely the opportunities it gives me to learn new things and explore different aspects of our universe. I'm constantly learning, whether it's about the latest spacecraft technology or the latest findings from our research missions. And of course, getting to fly in space is the ultimate thrill!</p>

            <p><b>Q: How do you get wifi in space?</b></p>

            <p>A: There is no wifi in space! However, astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) can connect to the internet using a special satellite system.</p>

            <p><b>Q: What does space smell like?</b></p>

            <p>A:There is no smell in space! However, when astronauts return to Earth, they sometimes say that their space suits smell like burnt steak.</p>

            <p><b>Q: What do you eat in space?</b></p>

            <p>A: We have a variety of food on the space station, including food that is tube-fed.</p>

            <p><b>Q: How do astronauts prepare for a spacewalk?</b></p>

            <p>A:Before a spacewalk, or extravehicular activity (EVA), astronauts suit up in a spacesuit that protects them from the harsh environment of space. They also go through a variety of safety checks and procedures to make sure everything is working properly.Astronauts typically spend about five to eight hours preparing for a spacewalk. This includes time to suit up, check all the equipment, and go through a safety briefing.</p>

            <p><b>Q: Has anyone ever had sex in space?</b></p>

            <p>A: There is no definitive answer to this question as it has never been officially recorded or confirmed. However, there have been several instances where astronauts have hinted at or discussed the possibility of sexual activity in space.</p>

            <p><b>Q: How do you go to the bathroom in space?</b></p>

            <p>A: Astronauts use a variety of methods to relieve themselves in space, depending on the situation. For solid waste, they use a specialised toilet that uses suction to move the waste into a storage container. For liquid waste, they use a system of tubes and pumps that collect and store the urine for later disposal.</p>

            <p><b>Q: How do you exercise in space?</b></p>

            <p>A: Astronauts have to exercise for at least two hours every day to counteract the effects of microgravity on their bodies. They use a variety of exercise equipment, including treadmills, stationary bikes, and resistance training devices.</p>

            <p><b>Q: What do you do for fun in space?</b></p>

            <p>A: Astronauts have a few options for recreational activities in space. They can watch movies, read books, listen to music, and stay in touch with their families and friends back on Earth.</p>

            <p><b>Q:Do you, like, miss Earth sometimes?</b></p>

            <p>A: Yes, I definitely miss Earth sometimes. I miss being able to go outside and breathe fresh air and feel the sun on my skin. But I also love being in space and exploring everything it has to offer.</p>
